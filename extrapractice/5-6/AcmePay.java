/*
Acme Parts runs a small factory and employs workers who are paid one of
three hourly rates depending on their shift:
first shift, $17 per hour;
second shift, $18.50 per hour;
third shift, $22 per hour.
Each factory worker might work any number of hours per week;
any hours greater than 40 are paid at one and one-half times the usual rate.
In addition, second- and third-shift workers can elect to participate in the
retirement plan for which 3% of the workerâ€™s gross pay is deducted from the paychecks.

Write a program that prompts the user for hours worked, shift, and, if the shift
is 2 or 3, whether the worker elects the retirement (1 for yes, 2 for no). Display:

1. Hours worked
3. Hourly pay rate
4. Regular pay
5. Overtime pay
6. Total of regular and overtime pay
7. Retirement deduction, if any
8. Net pay
2. Shift
