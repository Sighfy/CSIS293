In the ChiliToGo program in Exercise 12,
the costs to produce an adult meal and
a childâ€™s meal are $4.35 and $3.10,
respectively. Adult meals are sold
for $7 and children's meals are sold
for $4. Modify the ChiliToGo program
to display the total profit for each
type of meal as well as the grand total profit.
