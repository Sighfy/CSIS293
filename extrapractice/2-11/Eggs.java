/*
Meadowdale Dairy Farm sells organic
brown eggs to local customers. It charges
$3.25 for a dozen eggs, or
45 cents for individual eggs
that are not part of a dozen.
Write a program that prompts a user for the
number of eggs in the order and then display
the amount owed with a full explanation using
the following wording:
You ordered 27 eggs.
Thatâ€™s 2 dozen at $3.25 per dozen and
3 loose eggs at 45 cents each for a total of $7.85.
