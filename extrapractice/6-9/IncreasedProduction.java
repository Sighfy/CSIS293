/*
The Freemont Automobile Factory has discovered that the longer a worker has been on the job,
the more parts the worker can produce. Write an application that computes and displays a
workerâ€™s anticipated output each month for 24 months assuming the worker starts by producing
4,000 parts and increases production by 6 percent each month. Also display the month in which
production exceeds 7,000 parts (when the worker deserves a raise!) as follows:
The month in which production exceeds 7000.0 is month X.
