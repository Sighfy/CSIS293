Create a class to hold data about a high school sports team.
The Team class holds data fields for high school name
(such as Roosevelt High), sport (such as Girlsâ€™ Basketball),
and team name (such as Dolphins). Include a constructor that
takes parameters for each field, and include get methods that
return the values of the fields. Also include a public final
static String named MOTTO and initialize it to Sportsmanship!.
