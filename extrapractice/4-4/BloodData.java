/*
Create a class named BloodData that includes fields
that hold a blood type
(the four blood types are O, A, B, and AB)
and an Rh factor (the factors are + and â€“).
Create a default constructor that sets the
fields to O and +, and an overloaded constructor
that requires values for both fields.
Include get and set methods for each field.
